# Rotation-Matrix

 steps for the Matrix Rotation Tool project:

## Step 1: Input Matrix Size

Users provide the desired size of the matrix (e.g., 3x3, 4x4).


## Step 2: Generate Grid
Clicking the 'Generate' button creates a grid where users can input values for each cell in the matrix.

## Step 3: Input Matrix Values
Users populate the grid by entering values into each cell, forming the original matrix.

## Step 4: Rotate the Matrix
After inputting values, users click the 'Rotate' button.

## Output: Matrix Rotation
The original matrix is rotated by 90 degrees in a clockwise direction.

Both the original and rotated matrices are displayed step by step.
Users can visualize the transformation and observe how the matrix changes at each step.
These steps provide a clear sequence of actions and the corresponding output for the Matrix Rotation Tool project.
